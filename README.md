# Economic Status vs. Health Status and Education System in Countries

Central Question
Does a better economic status indicate a better health status and education system in countries?

Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze the correlation between economic status and key societal indicators: health and education. By integrating data from various sources, the project creates a comprehensive dataset representing countries across different economic statuses. The analysis involves plotting the relationships between GDP and life expectancy, as well as GDP and literacy rates, to observe potential relationships.

Data Sources
1. GDP Data (DATA_SOURCE_1): List of countries by GDP (2020)
      Description: Annual market value of all final goods and services from a country.

2. Life Expectancy Data (DATA_SOURCE_2): List of countries by Life expectancy (2022)
      Description: Average number of years a newborn would live under current age-specific mortality rates.

3. Literacy Rate Data (DATA_SOURCE_3): List of countries by Literacy Rate
      Description: Estimate of the percentage of the population that can read and write in member countries of the UN.

Methodology
- Creating a large database comprising countries represented in all three datasets.
- Divisional analysis for ease of data interpretation.
- Plotting relationships between GDP and life expectancy, and GDP and literacy rates.

Observations and Analysis
- No linear relationship observed between the datasets.
- Countries with higher GDP tend to have higher life expectancy and literacy rates.

Conclusion
- Limited complexity due to the use of a single table. Efforts were made to incorporate complex queries suitable for a single-table analysis.
- This project sheds light on the relationship between a country's economic status and its societal health and education standards. While higher GDPs tend to correlate with better life expectancy and literacy rates, the relationship is not strictly linear and warrants further exploration.
